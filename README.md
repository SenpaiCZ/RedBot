# Change Log

31st August 2023 - New Features and Enhancements

**Automatic Calculations:** After filling in all the required stats, the system now automatically calculates HP, MP, LUCK, MOV, BUILD, and Damage Bonus. This streamlines the process and ensures accurate character progression.

**Simplified Language (own) and Dodge:** Language (own) and Dodge stats will now be automatically populated as you fill in other related stats, reducing manual input.

**MAX_MP and MAX_HP:** Introducing MAX_MP and MAX_HP stats that are automatically updated upon calculation. You can edit these values just like regular stats.

These enhancements aim to make character management more efficient and provide you with a smoother gameplay experience. Enjoy your adventures in the world of Cthulhu!
